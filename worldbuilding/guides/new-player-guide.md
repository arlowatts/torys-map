Don't have time for all this reading? That's okay! The most important part is the section titled [Creating a character](#creating-a-character) and that you have an understanding of the sword and sorcery fantasy genre. Everything else you can easily pick up along the way, and if you have any questions, just ask!

## Introduction

Tuvdak's Gift is a lighthearted fantasy roleplaying adventure for players of any experience level. It is set on the tropical volcanic island of **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron**, home to the world's largest dragons - and kobold clans! As players, you will all play as kobolds from the **Bekebel** clan, the largest clan of kobolds on the island. The Bekebel clan is ruled by **Babanak the Great**, a powerful sorcerer, and worships **Tuvdak the Magnificent**, an ancient red dragon known across the realm for his supremacy.

## Premise

It is customary for the Bekebel clan to give a gift to Tuvdak on every ninth day, demonstrating their devotion. Today, however, the gift was lost in a disastrous mishap. Together you must traverse the massive **Bekebel Citadel** to recover the gift and present it to Tuvdak before he destroys the clan in his rage!

## What's a Kobold?

A kobold is a small humanoid creature with scaly skin and reptilian qualities, including a long face and a tail.

The population of the Bekebel clan is incredibly diverse, boasting 20 unique cultures and 3 distinct dialects of the common language. Most are unified in their worship of **Tuvdak the Magnificent** and reverence of **Tiamat**, god of all dragons, but some dissent. Please feel free to express yourself and your character however you wish - the sky is the limit!

Oh, and one more thing - did you know all kobolds give themselves a title? Well, they do! When you're making a character, try to think of a fun title like "the Great" or "the Mystic" to add some spice.

## What's Fantasy?

Fantasy is a genre of fiction that incorporates impossible elements into the setting such as magic, mythical creatures, and nonexistent technologies. It is closely related to science fiction.

This adventure will follow a style of fantasy called sword and sorcery. One of the key elements of sword and sorcery fantasy is limited technology. In this adventure, technology is limited to the pre-industrial era. This means there is no electricity and there are no steam or combustion engines - in general, the technology is mostly medieval. Another key element of sword and sorcery fantasy is magic. In this adventure, magic is very prevalent and everyone has at least some capacity to cast spells.

## Creating a Character

There are many ways to make a character - if you feel confident in your roleplaying skills, you can even improvise on the spot! Here are some aspects you can consider to help flesh out your character:

- What does your character want? What is driving them to go on adventures? Do they desire fame and fortune and everything that goes with it? Or are they trying to fulfill a promise to a lost loved one? This point is very important because it will keep your character strongly grounded no matter what happens during the adventure.
- Who should your character be? What do they do every day?
- Who did your character used to be? What's their background experience, and how did that shape their personality?
- What material possessions does your character have? Are they wealthy? Do they hold items of sentimental value? There might be some fighting, so it's not a bad idea to bring a weapon.
- Does your character have any living friends or relations? Are they married? Or even divorced? Did their dead relations have an impact on the character's ideals?
- Is your character a part of an organization, such as a charitable foundation? Or a cult?

There are many more things you can consider when making a character and you can do it however you like. What's important in the end is that you feel comfortable roleplaying that character and you understand their personality well enough to do so.

### I want to know more!

You're making your character and you want to tie it into the setting with a connection to an individual or group? And you want to hear about some likely candidates not described in this document? How did I guess! Don't hesitate to ask me for more information about the world to inform your character. Alternatively, tell me about your big ideas and they'll be incorporated directly into the setting!

## Mechanics of a Character

I'll just go right out and say it: Dungeons & Dragons is an overly complicated game. That's why we'll be playing a simplified version! I've never tried this before, so please reach out to me with any questions or suggestions!

While you're defining your character, consider their physical and mental characteristics. In the game, we will track these with six numbers:

- *Strength* represents your character's physical strength. It helps you hit things, carry things, throw things, and so on.
- *Dexterity* is your character's agility. A high dexterity score will help your character walk quietly, dodge attacks, and walk on narrow ledges without falling.
- *Constitution* represents how "tough" your character is. High constitution allows your character to take more hits before dying, hold their breath for longer, and run without getting tired.
- *Creativity* represents your character's ability to create. A high creativity score will help your character reach conclusions more quickly, cast spells, and come up with ideas. I'll never block an idea due to a character's low creativity, but if you're stuck in a tight spot, a high score might lead to some revelations...
- *Senses* covers intuition, insight, and your ability to see and hear. While creativity will help you figure out what a clue means, senses will let you find it in the first place, whether it's a slip of the tongue or a marking on the wall.
- *Charisma* represents your character's mastery of social interaction. With a high charisma score you can more easily persuade, intimidate, deceive, and perform.

To choose your values for each of these, simply rank them. That's it! Your best score gets a value of 6, your second best gets 5, and so on down to your worst score which gets 1. A higher number is always better, so choose your ordering carefully!

You can also choose five special "skills" for your character. If you can, draw these from your backstory - or let them inspire it! A skill in this context should be something pretty generic, like "stealth" or "persuasion" to make it more likely that it will be relevant in the game. While "knitting" would be a fun skill, I can't promise it'll ever come up! That being said, a creative use of a narrow skill may be rewarded. Skills are also typically less broad than the six ability scores described above. For example, if you are trying to scale a wall you might use your dexterity score and your "athletics" skill together to make it all the way up.

## Other Game Mechanics

Your character also has a couple other properties like hit points and spell points, but we'll figure these out on the day of the game based on your ability scores. Every character also has the ability to cast spells, expending spell points. A higher creativity score will let you cast more and better spells!

The game is mostly roleplaying, but there will be some dice involved to settle random outcomes. We'll use all kinds of dice, so feel free to bring whatever you have!

Many of the game's other mechanics will be taken directly from, or at least inspired by, the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons. If you know them, that's great - if you don't, that's also great! Everything included in this simplified version is fairly intuitive, so it should be relatively easy to catch on.

### A note about magic

If you've played D&D before, you may have noticed that we don't have classes here - or spells! That is because anyone can cast any spell they want, as long as their creativity score is high enough and they have enough spell points remaining. There is also no spell list - to cast a spell, simply state the desired effect and spend your spell points!
