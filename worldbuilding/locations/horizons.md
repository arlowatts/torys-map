title: Evening, Morning, and Noon-night Horizons
---

Since Torys has magnetic poles, cardinal directions can be evaluated just like on any spherical planet, where north is the direction to the north pole, south is the direction to the south pole, east is to the right when facing north, and west is to the left when facing north. Unlike on a spherical planet, however, the north and south poles are not points but circular bands.

## Evening Horizon

The **Evening Horizon** is the part of the world that is eclipsed at sunset. Along this slice, the opposite side of Torys is visible above the horizon, but there is no gap between the two.

## Morning Horizon

Similar to the Evening Horizon, the **Morning Horizon** is the part of the world that is eclipsed at sunrise. Along this slice, the opposite side of Torys is visible above the horizon, but there is no gap between the two.

## Noon-night Horizon

The **Noon-night Horizon** is the innermost part of the planet. Along this slice, the opposite side of the planet is directly overhead, so the sun is eclipsed at noon each day. The magic of the **Eclipse** is more powerful here than anywhere else on Torys.
